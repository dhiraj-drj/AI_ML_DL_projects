It focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and binary classification.\n","\n","1. Workflow Overview:\n","The project follows a structured data science pipeline:\n","\n","Data Collection: Uses a labeled dataset (from Kaggle) containing several thousand news articles categorized as real (0) or fake (1).\n","\n","Pre-processing: Converting textual information into numerical data that a machine can interpret.\n","\n","Model Training: Utilizing Logistic Regression for classification.\n","\n","Evaluation: Using accuracy scores to determine how well the model identifies fake news.\n","\n","2. Dataset Features\n","The dataset contains approximately 20,800 entries with five main columns:\n","\n","ID: Serial number of the news article.\n","\n","Title: The headline of the article.\n","\n","Author: The writer of the news.\n","\n","Text: The full body of the article.\n","\n","Label: Marks the news as real (1) or fake (0).\n","\n","3. Key Technical Steps\n","Handling Missing Values: Missing data in the title, author, or text columns are replaced with \"null strings\" (empty text) to ensure the model can process every row.\n","\n","Feature Engineering: The author merges the Author name and Title into a single column called content. This combined text is used as the primary feature for prediction because it provides high accuracy with less computational load than processing the entire article text.\n","\n","Text Stemming:\n","\n","Stemming: Reducing words to their root form (e.g., \"acting\" becomes \"act\").\n","\n","Stopwords Removal: Removing common words like \"the,\" \"a,\" and \"is\" that do not add significant meaning to the analysis.\n","\n","Regular Expressions: Used to strip away numbers, punctuation, and special characters, leaving only alphabetic words.\n","\n","Vectorization (TF-IDF): we  use the TF-IDF Vectorizer (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical feature vectors. This method highlights significant words that appear frequently in a specific document but not across the entire dataset.\n","\n","4. Model Training & Mathematics\n","Logistic Regression: Chosen because it is highly effective for binary classification (Real vs. Fake).\n","\n","Sigmoid Function: This  briefly explains the math, showing how the model maps input data to a probability between 0 and 1. If the probability is above 0.5, it's classified as fake; if below, it's real.\n","\n","Train-Test Split: The data is split (80% for training, 20% for testing) to ensure the model's performance can be validated on unseen data.\n","\n","5. Performance & Results\n","Accuracy: The model achieved an impressive 98% to 99% accuracy on both the training and test datasets.\n","\n","Predictive System: The final section demonstrates building a simple interface where a user can input a piece of news, and the system correctly identifies if it is real or fake based on the trained parameters."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Axz4nx1BTtzw"},"source":["Importing the
